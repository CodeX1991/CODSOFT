# 4 WEEK INTERNSHIP AT CODSOFT
 A 4-weeks Internship with Codsoft. The internship focus on building application using python.<br><br>
 ***If you carry out the installation below as regard setting up the virtual environment and installation of
 dependencies, you should skip that process in each of the project. It suffices for all project requirements.***
 
### Projects
- **TO-DO LIST:**
  A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage
  and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
  command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing
  users to create, update, and track their to-do lists
  
- **CALCULATOR:**
  Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
  Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
  Perform the calculation and display the result.
  
- **PASSWORD GENERATOR:**
  A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and
  random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
  password generator application using Python, allowing users to
  specify the length and complexity of the password.<br>
  User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the
  password.<br> Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to
  generate a password of the specified length.<br>
  Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.
  
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:**
  User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.<br>
  Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for
  the computer.<br>
  Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the
  computer's choice.<br>
  Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.<br>
  Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
  Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.<br>
  Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for
  multiple rounds.<br>
  Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
  User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and
  feedback.
  
- **Contact Book:**
  Contact Information: Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.<br>
  Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts with their details.<br>
  View Contact List: Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.<br>
  Search Contact: Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.<br>
  Update Contact: Enable users to update contact details.<br>
  Delete Contact: Provide an option to delete a contact.<br>
  User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
